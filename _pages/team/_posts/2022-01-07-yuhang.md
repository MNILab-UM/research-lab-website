Yuhang Li is a forth-year Ph.D. student in the lab. Prior to joining the Li Lab, he received his Bachelor’s degree from East China Normal University. He is interested in investigating the neural mechanisms that underlie the social impairment present in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), by utilizing a range of methodologies, such as EEG, fNIRS, fMRI, and hyperscanning. His Ph.D. project has three primary objectives: 1\) To explore the atypical inter-brain synchrony underlying social impairment in children with ASD through the implementation of hyperscanning techniques. 2\) To elucidate the connections between inter-brain synchrony and other characteristics of ASD social impairments. 3\) To construct computational models that can forecast the longitudinal development of ASD based on a multi-modal interpersonal synchrony profile.
