Our paper, entitled "Divergent electroencephalogram resting-state functional network alterations in subgroups of autism spectrum disorder: a symptom-based clustering analysis", is published in the journal Cerebral Cortex. We presented a symptom-based subgroup identification method to explore the resting-state functional connectivity of ASD subgroups, with the purpose of addressing the heterogeneity of ASD. This research is led by Prof. Rihui Li at the CCBS of UM and Prof. Guang Yang at the PLA General Hospital. Doctoral student Yuhang Li at UM and Gang Zhu at PLA General Hospital are the co-first authors of this work.
