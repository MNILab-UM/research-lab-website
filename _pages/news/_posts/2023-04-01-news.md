Our paper, entitled "Association of Intrinsic Functional Brain Network and Longitudinal Development of Cognitive Behavioral Symptoms in Young Girls With Fragile X Syndrome", is published in the journal Biological Psychiatry. We present the results of a study specifically designed to investigate resting-state large-scale brain network characteristics in young girls with FXS, an important but underrepresented clinical population.
