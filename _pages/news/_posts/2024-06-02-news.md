Our paper, entitled "Associations between brain network, puberty, and behaviors in boys with Klinefelter syndrome", is published in the journal European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (IF=6, Q1). In this study, we investigated alterations in the resting-state brain network, testosterone level, and cognitive-behavioral impairment in adolescents with Klinefelter syndrome. This research is led by Prof. Rihui Li at the CCBS of UM and Prof. Allan Reiss at Stanford University.
