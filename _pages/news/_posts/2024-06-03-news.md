Our paper, entitled "Longitudinal changes in functional neural activation and sensitization during face processing in fragile X syndrome", is published in the journal Biological Psychiatry (IF=9.6, Q1). This pioneering longitudinal research is the first to uncover abnormal patterns of neural activity changes during face processing in FXS girls as they progress through puberty. This research is led by Prof. Rihui Li at the CCBS of UM and Dr. Yuanyuan Gao at Stanford University.
