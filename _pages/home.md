## **About the Lab**

The **MNI (Multimodal Neuroimaging) Lab**, led by **Prof. Rihui Li** at the Centre for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, University of Macau, is at the forefront of understanding human brain function through cutting-edge neuroimaging technologies and computational approaches. Our laboratory bridges the gap between advanced brain imaging methods and real-world applications in neuroscience and clinical practice.
#### **Our Mission**
We are dedicated to enhancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying both typical and atypical human behaviors. Through the integration of multiple brain imaging modalities and innovative computational methods, we aim to decode complex brain processes and develop new insights into neurological and psychiatric disorders.
#### **Research Focus Areas**
#### **Multimodal Brain Imaging Innovation**
We develop and integrate advanced neuroimaging techniques including functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT), Electroencephalography (EEG), and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to achieve unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution in brain imaging.
#### **Brain Network Analysis**
Our lab employs sophisticated static and dynamic brain network analyses to understand the neural foundations of human behaviors, with particular emphasis on social interaction and team collaboration dynamics.
#### **Computational Neuroscience**
We establish computational models that elucidate the complex relationships between brain function, physiology, and behavior, particularly in the context of neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative, and neurodevelopmental disorders.
#### **Clinical Applications**
Our research extends beyond basic neuroscience to address real-world clinical challenges, including early detection and treatment monitoring for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Fragile X syndrome, and Autism.
#### **What Makes Us Unique**

- Hyperscanning Technology: We utilize state-of-the-art hyperscanning methods to study real-time brain synchronization during natural social interactions
EEG-informed fNIRS Analysis: Our lab has pioneered innovative approaches that combine the temporal precision of EEG with the spatial specificity of fNIRS
- Translational Research: We bridge fundamental neuroscience discoveries with clinical applications, developing potential biomarkers for treatment studies
- Collaborative Environment: Located within the internationally recognized Centre for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, we maintain active collaborations with leading institutions including Stanford University

#### **Laboratory Capabilities**
Our lab is equipped with advanced neuroimaging systems and computational resources that enable comprehensive brain function assessment. We offer expertise in concurrent EEG/fNIRS recordings, advanced signal processing, machine learning applications in neuroscience, and multimodal data integration techniques.
